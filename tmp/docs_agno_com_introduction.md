##  What is Agno
Agno is the runtime for agentic software. Build agents, teams, and workflows. Run them as scalable services. Monitor and manage them in production.
Layer | What it does
---|---
**Framework** | Build agents, teams, and workflows with memory, knowledge, guardrails, and 100+ integrations.
**Runtime** | Serve your system in production with a stateless, session-scoped FastAPI backend.
**Control Plane** | Test, monitor, and manage your system using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

##  What You Can Build
Agno powers real agentic systems built from the same primitives above.
  * [**Pal →**](https://github.com/agno-agi/pal) A personal agent that learns your preferences.
  * [**Dash →**](https://github.com/agno-agi/dash) A self-learning data agent grounded in six layers of context.
  * [**Scout →**](https://github.com/agno-agi/scout) A self-learning context agent that manages enterprise context knowledge.
  * [**Gcode →**](https://github.com/agno-agi/gcode) A post-IDE coding agent that improves over time.
  * [**Investment Team →**](https://github.com/agno-agi/investment-team) A multi-agent investment committee that debates and allocates capital.

Single agents. Coordinated teams. Structured workflows. All built on one architecture.

##  Start Building
Agno is designed to scale with you.
  * Build your first agent with memory, knowledge, and tools.
  * Build intelligent programs that reason, use tools, and take action.
  * Coordinate multiple agents to collaborate and reach decisions.
  * Orchestrate deterministic and agentic steps into structured systems.
  * Deploy, govern, and operate agents in production.

Start small with a single agent. Or build distributed, governed multi-agent systems from day one.

##  Built for Production
Agno runs in your infrastructure, not ours.
  * Stateless, horizontally scalable runtime.
  * 50+ APIs and background execution.
  * Per-user and per-session isolation.
  * Runtime approval enforcement.
  * Native tracing and full auditability.
  * Sessions, memory, knowledge, and traces stored in your database.

You own the system. You own the data. You define the rules.
